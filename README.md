# Cylera Frontend Developer Take-home Programming Assignment

## Getting Started

This is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app --template typescript`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) and modified to provide a starting point for this assignment. You are free to update the starting point as you see fit. To get started simply:

1. Install dependancies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
4. Make changes in `src/` and elsewhere as needed to implement your solution.
